#### Project Details

While I check some email templates on ReallyGoodEmails I noticed that most of the email templates out there are built with media queries in order to make them mobile friendly but that has some drawbacks because some email platforms don't fully support media queries and that can lead to disastrous results.

So I decided to recreate this <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/lets-get-gifting" target="_blank">email template</a> from scratch using Fluid-hybrid approach which I learned in this <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-future-proof-responsive-email-without-media-queries--cms-23919?_ga=2.143593660.887699798.1657106175-1146721899.1652875125" target="_blank">excellent article</a> from Nicole Merlin. 

Here is the email template that I created which supports the Fluid-hybrid method with some media queries for Progressive Enhancement. The email template looks perfect on these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoCyIW3D644">email platforms</a>
